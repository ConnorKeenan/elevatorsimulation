# elevatorsimulation
A repository for CS216 elevator simulation. This is a class project would appreciate no submissions, thank you.

The elevator simulation will start with the skeleton program running only one elvator on a small amount of levels/floors with a queue of passengers. While the finished project will have a bank of elevators covering a vast amount of floors/levels and passengers.
